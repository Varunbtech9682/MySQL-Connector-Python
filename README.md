Project Title: MySQL CRUD Operations with Python
Overview:
This project demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MySQL database with a Python script. It provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) allowing users to interact with the database by inserting, updating, selecting, and deleting records from a 'users' table.

Features:
Insert: Insert new records into the 'users' table with name, age, and city fields.
Update: Update existing records in the 'users' table based on their unique identifier (ID).
Select: Display all records from the 'users' table in a tabular format.
Delete: Remove records from the 'users' table based on their unique identifier (ID).
Technologies Used:
Python
MySQL
mysql-connector-python library for Python
tabulate library for tabular output formatting
How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python and MySQL installed.
Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Update the MySQL connection details (host, username, password, database) in the Python script.
Run the script (python crud_operations.py) and follow the on-screen instructions to perform CRUD operations.
Future Improvements:
Implement error handling for invalid user inputs.
Add validation for data types and lengths before executing SQL queries.
Enhance user interface for better user experience.
